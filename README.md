# Phishing-URL-Classifier

## Problem Description :
With the increasing reliance on the internet for financial transactions, personal communications, and business operations, phishing attacks have emerged as a significant cybersecurity threat. Phishing websites impersonate legitimate entities to deceive users into revealing sensitive information, such as passwords, credit card details, and personal data.

Detecting phishing websites accurately and efficiently is a crucial challenge in cybersecurity. Traditional methods, such as blacklists, fail to detect new phishing sites in real time. Therefore, machine learning-based approaches using URL and webpage source code features have gained prominence in identifying phishing threats proactively.

In this project, we utilize the PhiUSIIL Phishing URL Dataset, which contains 134,850 legitimate URLs and 100,945 phishing URLs, to develop a robust phishing detection model. The dataset includes features extracted from the webpage source code and URL structure, such as CharContinuationRate, URLTitleMatchScore, URLCharProb, and TLDLegitimateProb, which are derived from existing URL-based attributes.

## Objective :
To analyze these features and implement machine learning techniques to classify URLs as legitimate or phishing, improving the accuracy and efficiency of phishing detection systems. Through this project, we aim to contribute to the development of automated security solutions that help protect users from online fraud and cyber threats.
